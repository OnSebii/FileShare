## Getting started

### Installing NodeJs

You will need NodeJs ( > version 14.0 ) and npm. To check whether it's already installed on your system, open up a terminal window and type `node -v` or `npm -v` at the command prompt. For example, you should see something similar to the following:

```
node -v
v14.10.0

npm -v
6.14.10
```

### Installing PostgreSQL

You also need PostgreSQL as Database. Download [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your operating system.
