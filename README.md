## Getting started

## Installing NodeJs

You will need NodeJs ( > version 14.0 ) and npm. To check whether it's already installed on your system, open up a terminal window and type `node -v` at the command prompt. For example, you should see something similar to the following:

```
node -v
v14.10.0
```
